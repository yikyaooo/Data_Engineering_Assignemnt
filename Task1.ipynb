However, most businesses are allowed to open with certain health and safety protocols enforced.\\n \\nOn a question whether divers can travel across districts for this purpose, Masidi said it was not possible as the travel ban is still being enforced.\\n \\n\\u201cSo while we do allow diving even in red zones within the parameters of the respective district, divers are not allowed to travel to another district, \\u201d he explained.\\n \\nIn another development, when asked if it was advisable for the Bugaya by-election to be held amid the pandemic as it was set for January, Masidi reiterated that the constitution required the state seat to be filled following the death of its representative, the late Manis Muka Mohd Darah.\\n \\nHowever, he stressed that their top priority remains managing the pandemic in Sabah and hoped the by-election could be delayed, taking a cue from the handling of the Batu Sapi seat.\\n \\n\\u201cIf we take Batu Sapi as an example, there is a way to avoid by-elections now.\\n \\n\\u201cWe hope the Election Commission (EC) will look into this as an option that can be considered, but we are aware the power to announce a State of Emergency is with the Agong, following advice from the government.\\n \\n\\u201cPolitics can wait. We tackle the pandemic first, \\u201d said Masidi.\\n \\nMeanwhile, commenting on the increase in clinical waste following the high number of cases in Sabah, Masidi said this is being monitored by the state government via the Environmental Department.\\n \\nHe was responding to concerns raised about medical waste piling up outside a clinical waste disposal company\\u2019s compound in Lok Kawi, awaiting disposal.\\n \\nMasidi said monitoring has been done since March this year when the virus spread, where one company (Sedafiat Sdn Bhd), has been licensed to treat and dispose the clinical waste.\\n \\n\\u201cThe company collects about six to 13 metric tonnes of clinical waste per day from the 45 quarantine centres in Sabah.\\n \\n\\u201cAs a step to expedite the disposal of the waste, the Environmental Department has permitted the company to have the clinical waste disposed of in Peninsular Malaysia, \\u201d said Masidi, where the Health Ministry was to assist in expediting the logistics of the containers carrying the clinical waste at points of ports.\\n \\nThe government has also ordered the company to expedite building an incinerator for disposal purposes in Sabah, he added.\"\n",

The Lancet is one of the world\\u2019s oldest and most renowned weekly peer-reviewed general medical journals.\\n \\nIn a press release Monday (Nov 23), the taskforce said its members come from a diverse set of scientific disciplines and backgrounds, with expertise in outbreak investigation, virology, lab biosecurity and disease ecology.\\n \\nOne of the members is prominent Malaysian virologist Emeritus Prof Datuk Dr Lam Sai Kit - a leader in emerging viral infections who was also central to the discovery of the Nipah virus.\\n \\n\\\"It is timely to form the commission as we now have more comprehensive data and materials to work with. This allows the commission to provide a 'state-of-the art' assessment and offer governments, civil society, and United Nations institutions practical solutions and recommendations in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, \\u201d Dr Lam told Bernama Monday.\\n \\n\\\"This taskforce has been given 12 months to conduct an objective and rigorous scientific review of all available information on the origins, early control of the pandemic, and One Health solutions to future pandemic threats, \\u201d said Lam, who is also a research consultant at Universiti Malaya and a Senior Fellow at the Academy of Sciences Malaysia.\\n \\nOne Health is an approach to design and implement programmes, policies, legislation and research in which multiple sectors communicate and work together to achieve better public health outcomes.\\n \\nIn its investigation, the taskforce will recreate the Covid-19 outbreak timeline from the end of the SARS outbreak in 2003 up to WHO\\u2019s declaration of Covid-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on Jan 30,2020.\\n \\nThey will also analyse the available evidence for each of the hypotheses put forward on the origins of Covid-19 and compare the early spread and control to previous outbreaks.\\n \\nThis is so that they can identify strategies that might assist future pandemic prevention, the taskforce said.\\n \\nIn the release, Dr Jeffrey D.

I just took a chance and continued. If I managed to get there, then it would be great, \\u201d he told reporters at his residence here Wednesday (Nov 18).\\n \\nEn route, one of his children told him that he felt a burning sensation on his leg, prompting Amran to check the motorcycle and finding that it had caught fire.\\n \\n\\u201cFortunately, the police there helped us out but the motorcycle was completely destroyed. It can only be sold as scrap metal, \\u201d said Amran, who works as a fisherman.\\n \\nAmran, who has a deformity in his left hand since birth, has not been out to sea for a long time.\\n \\n\\u201cI used to earn RM1,000 a month but now I can only earn around RM600, \\u201d he said, adding that because of this he was unable to send his children to school.\\n \\n\\u201cI wish I could send my children to attend school but I have other commitments and dependents.\\n \\n\\u201cTo send them to school, I need to buy them school uniforms and shoes, which I simply can\\u2019t afford. I need to save at least for a week just to get a pair of school shoes, \\u201d said Amran, who could not hold back his tears while receiving the assistance from Yapeim.\\n \\n\\u201cThis is for my children and family. Thank you, \\u201d said Amran who also has two other small children, aged 18 months and one month respectively.\\n \\nMeanwhile, state YAPEIM manager Tajul Ariffin Harun said his team came forward to offer assistance after learning about Amran\\u2019s misfortune on social media.\\n \\n\\u201cIt is a one-off assistance. The contributions are in the form of basic daily necessities such as oil, rice, flour, sugar and others which are estimated to be worth around RM100, \\u201d he added.\\n \\nSince September 2019 until November this year, YAPEIM has channeled assistance to 7,160 families in need. \\u2013 Bernama\"\n",

Saravanan \\n(pic)\\n.\\n \\nThe Human Resources Minister said the enforcement of Act 446, effective from Sept 1, stipulated the need for employers to obtain a certificate of accommodation from the Labour Department of Peninsular Malaysia (JTKSM).\\n \\nSince then, the JTKSM Headquarters and State Labour Department (JTK) have also implemented comprehensive enforcement to ensure employers complied with Act 446.\\n \\n\\\"The implementation of continuous enforcement from Sept 1 to Nov 1 has also recorded an encouraging number of applications for certificate of accommodation from employers.\\n \\n\\\"A total of 2,668 applications for certificate of accommodation were recorded within the two-month period, with the manufacturing sector having the highest number of 1,562 applications,\\u201d he said in a statement on Sunday (Nov 15).\\n \\nSaravanan said that from September until the end of October, the ministry, through JTKSM and JTKs had conducted 1,322 enforcement and inspection activities nationwide.\\n \\nHe said compliance of Act 446 was very important and continuous enforcement was necessary to prove that Malaysia adhered to the standards drawn up by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in terms of combating elements of forced labour.\\n \\n\\\"This matter is very significant to the country since the provision of housing, accommodation and facilities for workers are among the crucial elements in forced labour criteria. This aspect of housing and accommodation for workers has been reprimanded by the US Department of Customs and Border Protection, especially involving the rubber glove manufacturing sector and the national oil palm industry.\\n \\n\\\"Apart from that, the compliance and implementation of this Act will also indirectly help in addressing the issue of human trafficking and migrant smuggling under the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act (Atipsom) 2007,\\u201d he said.\\n \\nSaravanan said enforcement activities were also continuously conducted in cooperation with relevant agencies to show that the ministry would not compromise on issues regarding forced labour and human trafficking.\\n \\nHe said a total of 90 inspections under the Atipsom Intergrated Ops had been carried out this year in collaboration with relevant agencies and the ministry had also set up a Technical Task Force Committee to monitor compliance with national labour laws and policies in five sectors associated with forced labour and human trafficking, namely rubber, plantation, services (restaurants and cleaning), electrical and electronics as well as furniture.\\n \\nHe urged employers who have yet to apply for the certificate of accommodation to immediately do so via online at http://akta446.mohr.gov.my.\\n \\nFor enquiries and advice on Act 446 and others within the department's jurisdiction, employers can contact the ministry and JTKSM at 03-8886 5192 / 03-8886 2409 / 03- 8886 2352 / 03-8888 9111or any Labour offices nearby.- Bernama\"\n",
